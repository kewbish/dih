## :pencil: Social Justice Action Plan - A First Look into the Web
I'm required to create a social justice action plan to benefit my community in some way, which I initially planned as a [Canada Learning Code](https://canadalearningcode.ca) meetup.  
However, with the recent COVID-19 outbreak, that's likely going to become unfeasible. Therefore, I thought that I'd bring the resources I created to y'all, and share my knowledge via an interactive tutorial to create a resume.
