      \nIn the past section, we've learned to:
      - Using a code editor, and how to preview 
      - Basic HTML tags - \`<p>\`, \`<div>\`, \`<a>\`, \`<img>\`, \`<h1>\`, \`<section>\` (and maybe you've come across others too!)
      - Structuring a site, and applying classes
      \nIn the next section, we'll be learning how to style our site, as well as what those class quotes really do.
      \nBy now, your site might look something like:
      \n![Figure 1: Just an example - we'll style it up soon!](https://i.imgur.com/hQ6i5jj.png)
      \n*Figure 1: Just an example - we'll style it up soon!*
